Powerpoint Timeline Tool
========================

The PPT Timeline Tool is a simple Microsoft Excel VBA macro that can generate nice timeline charts to be copied into Powerpoint presentations, by filling in a few basic
values in table rows in the sheet.

This sheet was originally created and sent around by someone in my current company, and I eventually became the maintainer some time ago. I updated it to work with Office 2007 (and later 2010) and now I have decided to make it available to everyone via github.

Compatibility and Requirements
-------------------------------

The sheet is currently known to work with Microsoft Excel 2007 and 2010. Please note that it does not work with Excel in the Mac OS X version of office (neither 2004 nor 2011).

The sheet obviously requires that the support for macros is activated.
